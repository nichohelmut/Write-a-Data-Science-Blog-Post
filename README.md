## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. 

Since I am a passionate football fan, I really enjoy taking looks at all different kinds of tables: local leagues, European champions competitions, continental and international tournaments like the UEFA EURO or FIFA world cup. The other day I discovered the All-time table of the FIFA World Cup. I instantly wondered what would happen, if you take different points of view e.g. subtract the home advantage, see if the continent where the tournament is played matters or create a new All-time table which includes scores from continental championships, qualification and friendly matches.

My key interests would be:

1. Do hosting countires have an higher probability in winning games than other participating countries due to home advantage?

2. How does the All-time table change if you extract the games with home advantage?

3. Which larger active tournament has the highest avg. goals per game?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The excel file 'all_time_world.xlsx' contains the All-time table of the FIFA World Cup. It compares men's national association football teams that have participated in the FIFA World Cup by several criteria including tournaments played, consecutive tournaments played or missed, matches, wins, draws, losses, goals,points, points per match, best finish, and confederation.
 
The csv file 'results.csv' contains a table with International football results from 1872 to 2019 including the FIFA world cup, continental competitions, qualification games, friendly games and many more.
